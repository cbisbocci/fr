Once in a while we all fall down into our personal manholes. It was in the pit of my undergraduate research years that I co-authored my own adventure of going _Down The Manhole_ with my dear friend and illustrator Louis Cicalese. I wrote the story while Cicalese brought the plot to life with his unique illustrative flair. Later I integrated both elements in Adobe InDesign to create a professional-grade novella.
